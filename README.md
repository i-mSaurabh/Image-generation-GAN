# DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) for Image Generation

This repository implements a **DCGAN** (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) using **TensorFlow**. The goal of this project is to generate realistic 28x28 images (using the **MNIST dataset**) from random noise. This technique involves adversarial training, where two neural networks (a generator and a discriminator) are trained simultaneously to improve each otherâ€™s performance.

- The **Generator** learns to create realistic images from random noise.
- The **Discriminator** tries to differentiate between real images (from the MNIST dataset) and fake images (generated by the Generator).

The generator improves its image generation ability, while the discriminator improves its ability to distinguish real from fake images.

## Key Features

- **Generator Model**: The generator network takes random noise as input and generates 28x28 grayscale images using `Dense`, `BatchNormalization`, and `Conv2DTranspose` layers. The generator gradually learns to produce more realistic images through adversarial training.
  
- **Discriminator Model**: The discriminator network classifies images as either "real" or "fake" using convolutional layers (`Conv2D`) to extract features from the images. It assigns a score based on how likely it thinks an image is real or fake.

- **Adversarial Training**: The generator and discriminator are trained together using binary cross-entropy loss. The generator tries to minimize its loss by fooling the discriminator into classifying fake images as real, while the discriminator tries to minimize its own loss by correctly distinguishing real images from fake ones.

- **Image Visualization**: The project generates images at the end of each epoch to track the progress of the generator. These images help you visually see the improvement in the generated images as training progresses.

- **GIF Creation**: After training, the project creates an animated **GIF** (`dcgan.gif`) to show the evolution of the generated images over time, allowing for easy visualization of how the generator improves with each epoch.
